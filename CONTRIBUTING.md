# Contributing

Any open source product is only as good as the community behind it. You can participate by sharing code, ideas, or simply helping others. No matter what your skill level is, every contribution counts.

See our [high level overview](http://silverstripe.org/contributing-to-silverstripe) on silverstripe.org on how you can help out.

## Contributing to the correct version

SilverStripe core and module releases (since the 3.1.8 release) follow close to the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org) (SemVar) specification for releases. Using this specification declares to the entire development community the 
severity and intention of each release. It gives developers the ability to safely declare their dependencies and
understand the scope involved in each upgrade.

It is important that your pull requests are submitted against the correct branch. The general guide is as follows:

 * Most changes, including new features, should be applied to the default branch in GitHub.
 * Low-risk bugfixes should be applied to the stable minor branch (e.g. the `3.1` branch).
 * API changes and high-risk changes should always go against the `master` branch.
 * Security fixes should be emailed to [security@silverstripe.com](mailto:security@silverstripe.com) instead.

For more information, including details of how and why we deviate slightly from the semantic versioning specification,
please see our [branch selection guide](http://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/branch_selection).

## Copyright

By supplying code to the SilverStripe core team in patches, tickets and pull requests, you agree to assign copyright of
that code to SilverStripe Limited, on the condition that SilverStripe Limited releases that code under the BSD license.

We ask for this so that the ownership in the license is clear and unambiguous, and so that community involvement doesn't
stop us from being able to continue supporting these projects.  By releasing this code under a permissive license, this
copyright assignment won't prevent you from using the code in any way you see fit.
